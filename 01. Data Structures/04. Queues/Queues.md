### Queues Overview:

In Computer Science a queue is an abstract Data Structure where items are kept in order. New items can be added at the back of the queue and old items are taken off from the front of the queue.

Items in a queue are traveserd in the FIFO ORDER (First-In-First-Out).

To understand queues in a realife senario, imagine a reallylong line of people trying to get food from a cafeteria:

- The first human to get to the line would obviousty be attended to first,
- then the next
- and so on
- till the last person on the line get served

In IT - a proper exapmle of a queue are waiting jobs in the server

- If the server is current;y carrying out some task, and then a request is made to it, this new reqest gets added to the wating queue in the order which they arrirve
- Once the current job completes execution, the first job to enter the waiting queue gets attented to first, then the next, and so on. Finally the last.

This orderly concept of queues can of course be bypassed by adding some conditional statement of order pf piority, which would be discused when in a bit.
